## CSC 212: DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS

## Course Description

CSC 212 introduces fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms, and their role in organizing and processing information efficiently. The course explores theoretical, implementation, and application aspects of important data structures and algorithms in use on modern computers. Particular emphasis is given to algorithms for searching and sorting. The course also covers basic concepts for analyzing space and time requirements of algorithms, critical for understanding their performance characteristics. C/C++ is the programming language required for programming assignments and lab sessions.

_Prerequisites: C- or better in CSC 211; and MTH 180 or Computer Engineering major, and understanding the basics of programming in a higher level language such as C, Java, or Python. You should be familiar with classes, objects, methods, functions, loops, conditionals, arrays._

- compare different algorithms and data structures based on efficiency, using empirical and theoretical algorithm analysis techniques;
- choose appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve a problem;
- implement sorting algorithms and understand their performance under different scenarios;
- implement and use basic data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, trees, balanced trees, and graphs;
- implement and use containers such as sets, maps, and hash tables.

## Lab Sessions

Lab sessions will be held on Wednesdays and Fridays. Lab sessions may involve short lectures on specific topics or live coding sessions given by TAs and instructors, followed by a set of exercises or problems. Students are required to solve all given exercises within the time allocated for the lab and turn in solutions through Gradescope by the due time. Lab work is individual and the solutions will not be graded, however, attendance to labs is part of the final grade and your submitted solutions will be used to track attendance.

## Assignments

Assignments are individual work, unless stated otherwise in the instructions. Students will have roughly 7-10 days to work on each assignment. Each assignment has a specific due date/time listed on the course website. Late submissions will not be accepted. Most programming assignments will be automatically graded on Gradescope. Students are strongly encouraged to bring their code to TA or instructor's office hours prior to the due date.

_While you are free to use any IDE for working on programming assignments and during the lab sessions, only Clion from JetBrains will be officially supported for this course. As well, source code submitted to the autograder must compile without any errors utilizing the g++ compiler._

## Exams

There is only one exam for this course: the final exam. The exam will be cumulative, timed, and consist of multiple choice questions.

## Term Project

The Final Project is to be done in groups of 3-4 students. The goal is to develop an application involving some of the algorithms and data structures studied during the semester. Your group will select a project from the list posted by the instructors. Most of the projects will require auxiliary reading and continuous effort throughout the semester. Two lab sessions will be reserved for live presentations of your final projects by the end of the semester.

## Gradebook Project

An extra credit project aimed to review and practice C++ while working within a group under a non-pressured project.

_Note: Semester grading will be complete by the Sunday evening prior to your final exam. Those with a weighted grade ≥ 90, will be exempt from the exam and granted their respective current grade:_

'A-' ≥ 90

'A' ≥ 94

## Submission & Late Policy

All submission must be properly submitted to Gradescope no later than 11:59p on the respective Monday it is due. Late submissions will not be accepted.

Extensions will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Please have proper documentation on-hand at time of request.

## Attendance Policy

There is no formal lecture attendance policy for this course. You may attend at your leisure. Please bear in mind, most who choose not to attend, end up repeating the course in a another semester.

Labs and the Project Presentation must be actively attended live to earn credit.

## Academic Enhancement Center

Nearly all students recognize that regardless of how well or poorly they are doing in a given class, there are ways to improve their learning and studying. The Academic Enhancement Center (AEC) and Writing Center (WC), located in Roosevelt Hall, offers several kinds of support that help students improve their learning and academic performance in this class as well as other classes. For information on any of these programs, visit the AEC website or call the AEC’s main number at (401) 874-2367.

## Academic Honesty

Discussions with peers to gain more insights on coursework and lectures is strongly encouraged. However, when working on assignments, all written work and source code must be original. Students might not look at anyone's written solution. Copying another individual solution is plagiarism, a serious offense, and the one most common in computer science courses. Anyone that provides homework answers, source code for a programming assignment to another individual is also guilty of academic dishonesty. Students caught plagiarizing will be prosecuted in accordance with the University's Policy of Academic Honesty.

## Disability Accommodations

Any student with a documented disability is welcome to contact me as early in the semester as possible, so that we may arrange reasonable accommodations. As part of this process, please be in touch with Disability, Access, and Inclusion Office.

## Religious Holidays

It is the policy of the University of Rhode Island to accord students, on an individual basis, the opportunity to observe their traditional religious holidays. Students desiring to observe a holiday of special importance must provide written notification to each instructor.
