## Course Description

``` {card}

CSC 212 introduces fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms, and their role in organizing and processing information efficiently. The course explores theoretical, implementation, and application aspects of important data structures and algorithms in use on modern computers. Particular emphasis is given to algorithms for searching and sorting. The course also covers basic concepts for analyzing space and time requirements of algorithms, critical for understanding their performance characteristics. C/C++ is the programming language required for programming assignments and lab sessions.

_Prerequisites: C- or better in CSC 211; and MTH 180 or Computer Engineering major, and understanding the basics of programming in a higher level language such as C, Java, or Python. You should be familiar with classes, objects, methods, functions, loops, conditionals, arrays._

## Student Learning Outcomes

``` {card}

Upon successful completion of this course, each student will be able to:

- implement code using pointers and dynamic memory allocation;
- implement solutions that involve recursive functions;
- compare different algorithms and data structures based on efficiency, using empirical and theoretical algorithm analysis techniques;
- choose appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve a problem;
- implement sorting algorithms and understand their performance under different scenarios;
- implement and use basic data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, trees, balanced trees, and graphs;
- implement and use containers such as sets, maps, and hash tables.

## Course Components

``` {card} Lectures

Discussion based sessions used to confirm understanding through reading and self-paced research.

```

``` {card} Labs

Practicum based sessions to confirm what you know and begin implemention of the material.

_Note: to recieve credit for lab, you must attend your respective section regardless of whether you are able to complete the lab within the session window._

```

``` {card} Assignments

Assignments are individual work, unless stated otherwise stated used to implement broader-scoped pracicum outcomes.

_While you are free to use any IDE for working on programming assignments and during the lab sessions, only Clion from JetBrains will be officially supported for this course. As well, source code submitted to the autograder must compile without any errors utilizing the g++ compiler._

```

``` {card} Projects

Two practicum projects will be completed. The first a review of concepts necessary to successfully complete the course, and the second a wide-ranged insight piece with a unique imlementation of the data structure[s] and/or alogorithm[s] with a formal presentation to your peers.

```

``` {card} Exam

There is only one exam for this course: the final exam. The exam will be cumulative, timed, and consist of multiple choice questions.

```

### Submission & Late Policy

``` {card}

All submission must be properly submitted to Gradescope no later than 11:59p on the respective Monday it is due. Late submissions will not be accepted.

Extensions will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Please have proper documentation on-hand at time of request.

```

## Attendance Policy

``` {card}

**Lecture**

There is no formal lecture attendance policy for this course. You may attend at your leisure. Please bear in mind, most who choose not to attend, end up repeating the course in a another semester.

**Lab & Project Presentations**

Must be actively attended live to earn credit.

```

## Administrative

``` {card} Academic Enhancement Center

Nearly all students recognize that regardless of how well or poorly they are doing in a given class, there are ways to improve their learning and studying. The Academic Enhancement Center (AEC) and Writing Center (WC), located in Roosevelt Hall, offers several kinds of support that help students improve their learning and academic performance in this class as well as other classes. For information on any of these programs, visit the AEC website or call the AECâ€™s main number at (401) 874-2367.

```

``` {card} Academic Honesty

Discussions with peers to gain more insights on coursework and lectures is strongly encouraged. However, when working on assignments, all written work and source code must be original. Students might not look at anyone's written solution. Copying another individual solution is plagiarism, a serious offense, and the one most common in computer science courses. Anyone that provides homework answers, source code for a programming assignment to another individual is also guilty of academic dishonesty. Students caught plagiarizing will be prosecuted in accordance with the University's Policy of Academic Honesty.

```

``` {card} Disability Accommodations

Any student with a documented disability is welcome to contact me as early in the semester as possible, so that we may arrange reasonable accommodations. As part of this process, please be in touch with Disability, Access, and Inclusion Office.

```

``` {card} Religious Holidays

It is the policy of the University of Rhode Island to accord students, on an individual basis, the opportunity to observe their traditional religious holidays. Students desiring to observe a holiday of special importance must provide written notification to each instructor.
