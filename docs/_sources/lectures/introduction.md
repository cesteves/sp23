``` {dropdown} ![image](img/intro_google_search.png)
This many hits denotes two things:
1. There is an impossible amount of information out there on the subject
1. When results fall in the ballpark of 20 million results, it's safe to safe it may be a topic worth understanding well...

```` {card} Facts

- Data Structures & Algorithms courses tend to have a lower success rate than many of their counterparts. This is the nature of the subject matter being difficult to grasp.

- Traditionally, these courses have about a 3:1 fail rate, meaning nearly 33% of students who enroll fail the course.
