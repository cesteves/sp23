```{admonition} Welcome!!
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main () {
    std::cout << "Hello Class!!"
              << "Welcome to Data Structures"
              << "Please review: start here, syllabus, and schedule..."
              << "The syllabus governs the course and the schedule"
              << "is linked to each of your deliverables for the term."

```{epigraph}
I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.

-- Linus Torvalds

```{epigraph}
The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.

-- Donald Knuth
