## Tips for Proper Completion & Work Expectations

Your work must unambiguously demonstrate mastery of the problem. It should be clearly and evidently your own. Instructor(s) and TAs should be unable to even question if your answers were copied. That is, your work should be beyond suspicion. It should be clear, correct and otherwise unimpeachable.

### Question 1

Code must be clearly traced OR an argument/proof with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants must be provided.

### Question 2

Code must be clearly traced OR an argument/proof with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants must be provided.

### Question 3

Code must be clearly traced OR the properties must be proved/disproved.

### Question 4

The recurrence relation must be solved through substitution OR iteration OR a recursion tree OR solved directly. An inductive proof is NOT required (but is FANTASTIC to see).

### Question 5

The recurrence relation must be solved through substitution OR iteration OR a recursion tree OR solved directly. An inductive proof is NOT required (but is FANTASTIC to see).

### Question 6

The performance of vector-based queues must be discussed. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided that no better implementation exists. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided (a data structure that can implement queue operations more efficiently).

### Question 7

None.

### Question 8

None.

### Question 9

None.

### Question 10

None.

### Question 11

Code must be clearly traced.

### Question 12

Must include drawings of trees. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided (drawings count).

### Question 13

Must include drawings of trees. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided (drawings count).

### Question 14

Must include a drawing of the binary search tree after the insertions OR an argument/proof must be provided with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants. 

### Question 15

Must include a drawing of the binary search tree after the insertions OR an argument/proof must be provided with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants. 

### Question 16

Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 

### Question 17

Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 

### Question 18

Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 

### Question 19

Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 

## Submission Expectations

Work can either be completed on a printed version of the PDF or in a PDF editor. 

If a printed version of the PDF is used, the submission can include pictures of or scanned versions of the pages, but they must be properly sized and aligned. 5 misaligned submissions require as much grading effort as the other 90 submissions. Do not expect credit for misaligned submissions. 

If a PDF editor is used, the document must still remain properly sized and aligned. Work must be clear and complete. If you need to use mathematical symbols and cannot type/draw them, consider printing the document instead. There is no difference in rigor expectations between handwritten and PDF edited submissions. Again, do not expect credit for misaligned submissions.
