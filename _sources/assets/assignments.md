# Assignments

Assignments are individual work, unless stated otherwise in the instructions. Students will have roughly 7-10 days to work on each assignment. Each assignment has a specific due date/time listed on the course website. Late submissions will not be accepted. Most programming assignments will be automatically graded on Gradescope. Students are strongly encouraged to bring their code to TA or instructor's office hours prior to the due date.

_While you are free to use any IDE for working on programming assignments and during the lab sessions, only Clion from JetBrains will be officially supported for this course. As well, source code submitted to the autograder must compile without any errors utilizing the g++ compiler._
